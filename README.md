# Turtle

Made different shapes using Turtle library in java.
## I made shapes:

- Triangle
- Star
- Square
- Circle
- SpiralSqaure

I have already added a package in this

## How to make package

Write package name in main file(turtle.java)
```
package "name_of_pkg"
```
then execute the file by using command
Here filename is turtle.java
```
javac -d .. "filename"
```

After that you can import this package wherever you want to import by writing 
```
import "name_of_pkg".*
```
